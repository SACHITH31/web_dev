# Tag❓ Element❓
- A tag is the part written inside angle brackets `<>`.
- Tags are used to create HTML elements.
- Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.
- The closing tag is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash **/** before the element name.
- Example of an opening and closing tag:
  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```
- In the example above, `<p>` is the opening tag and `</p>` is the closing tag.
- Some HTML elements are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.
- Example of a self-closing tag:
  ```html
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
  ```
- In the example above, `<img>` is a self-closing tag used to embed an image.
- Tags can also include attributes that provide additional information about the element.
- Example of a tag with attributes:
  ```html
  <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>
  ```
- In the example above, `<a>` is the opening tag with attributes `href` and `target`, and `</a>` is the closing tag.
